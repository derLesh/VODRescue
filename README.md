# VODRescue

Run the script localy or on a server to save your Twitch VOD/Clips

## Why

Twitch recently released an update about the current DMCA situation. If Twitch isn't down anything to provid the streamers with another to save their VODs/Clips they may be gone for every. To save those clips I try to make a user-friendly tool which saves the VODs/Clips on platform of your choise (Planned: YouTube, Google Drive, Local Hardware)

## How to use

Currently I dont have any plan LuL
